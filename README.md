<h1>Network Vulnerability Scanning and Assessments</h1>

 ### [Final Project Report](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16391991/EXTION.INFOTECH.PROJECT.1.pdf)


<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of the proactive approach of finding vulnerabilities the network and system is susceptable to in order to mitigate them but to ensure the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) of the organization is maintained , which is a primary goal within the Cybersecurity world. The project was achieved through two avenues powered by Nessus and the use of Linux through the "Nmap" command. The overall goal of the project was to identify potential vulnerabilities in the system to reduce potential risks and exploit done by threat actors. 
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Kali Linux Terminal</b> 
- <b>Nessus</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Kali Linux</b> (21H2)
- <b>Windows</b> (21H2)

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>
Given the project was using two avenues of primarily using Kali Linux terminal and Nessus , there was first the need to install Nessus to begin vulnerability scanning there. After that , was using the nmap command on the kali linux terminal to also begin scanning there. By the end of both scanning , two results from the sources were generated.

  Step one : Installing Nessus on Windows: <br/>

First go to the Nessus tenable website and begin installation. Select the Vulnerability Scanner and select the download page that will allow you to select configuartions based on your device and begin downloading.

<br />
<br />

Step two: Local host Nessus:  <br/>

One downloaded, it will set up a local host on your device. Ensure to create a username and password that you can use to log in.

<br />
<br />

Step three: Selecting Scanner: <br/>

When you log in , select new scan and it select Basic Network Scan. There are a number of scanners you can use , but for network scanning and identifying vulnerabilities , pick a basic network scanner. This allowed me to input the IP address of which source I want to investigate and will produce a report once completed.

<br />
<br />

Step four: Results from Scanner:  <br/>

Once I completed scanning , the report produced a total of 16 vulnerabilities with different categories. I performed two examinations : the first one had 16 vulnerabiities and the second one had 22 vulnerabilities.

<br />
<br />
Step five: Network Vulnerability Scanning on Kali Linux:  <br/>

Similarly to the scanning on Nessus , I used the IP address of the source being investigated and used the command "sudo nmap-p --script=vuln {ip address}"

<br />
<br />

Final Results:  <br/>

The project conduced by the security team at CDF was an overall success as it allowed us to identify, evaluate and protect our systems from vulnerabilities we are susceptible to as an organization. Through the use of Nessus and Nmap, six main vulnerabilities were found to exist with one being categorized as “High” while the rest maintained an overall scoring of “Medium”. The final report has been attached at the top of the page that lists all the vulnerabilities found according to their CVSS Score, why they are vulnerabilities and methods that security professionals can implement to mitigate these vulnerabilities and protect their systems.
